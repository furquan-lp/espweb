  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  This website is hosted entirely on an ESP8266 microcontroller (NodeMCU board) with just 4 megabytes of flash and
  128KB of SRAM!
  <div class="esp-img">
    <img src="esp8266.jpg" />
    Yup, this entire webpage is being served by this board, including this image!
  </div>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    The ESP8266 board has 4MB of flash storage out of which we reserve 1MB for the file system. Since this entire
    website is little more than 50KB, the storage is more than enough. The microcontroller connects to a local WiFi and
    creates a server over which the webpages and other files are served from its flash storage. There's a lot more to
    the process but that's the gist of it.

    Still don't believe it? Learn more about <a href="https://example.com">how it works</a> or you can <a
      href="https://github.com/furquan-lp/espweb">check the source code</a> yourself. I wrote a <a
      href="https://tctp.xyz/">blog post</a>
    over at my blog, <i>The Chip Tinker Project</i>, going into more detail and explaining how you can do this as well.
