  <h1>What even is ESPWeb?</h1>
  <p>ESPWeb is an entire website complete with your usual HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that is hosted on a NodeMCU
    (ESP8266) microcontroller with just 4MB of flash (of which only 1MB is used for this entire website) and 128KB (yes,
    kilobytes) of SRAM. You can even check the RAM use at the homepage (under "Server Info"). The single core
    <i>Xtensa</i> CPU on the board runs at a nominal 80MHz (it can be overclocked to 160MHz but I have no need for that,
    yet).
  </p>
  <h2>How is it even possible?</h2>
  <p>I'm sure you're wondering how it's even possible for such a performance constrained microcontroller board to host
    an entire functioning website. Well the entire website is a little more than 50KB so the available flash memory is
    not a problem. And while the performance is quite constrained on the device, very little happens server-side. Aside
    from calculating uptime, available heap, etc. much of the work is done by client-side JavaScript code. Still the
    memory needs to be carefully managed since unlike regular server systems, the stack is very limited so most of the
    strings need to be allocated on the heap, which, as you can image, poses its own problems.
  <p>The ESP8266 microcontroller device is surprisingly good at handling networking with WiFi so that's rarely a
    problem. Espressif have solved this issue so well that even with a tiny PCB-trace antenna the board is able to
    sustain a good connection with the available WiFi signal. </p>
  </p>
  <h2>How does it exactly work?</h2>
  <p>As with any other web application or website, the entire project is divided into the frontend (which you're seeing
    right now) and a backend server hosted on the microcontroller device. The standard boot cycle goes as follows:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ESP8266 device wakes up and connects to the available WiFi. It attempts the connection for about 20 seconds
      before it gives up and goes into a <i>deep sleep</i> mode until rebooted.</i></li>
    <li>After a connection is established, the device obtains a local IP address on the LAN and attaches a MDNS
      (Multicast DNS) local domain with its IP address.</li>
    <li> It then tries to look into the 1MB reserved SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System) space on its flash. Once it can find
      the <code>index.html</code>, <code>style.css</code> and <code>app.js</code> files, it starts an Asynchronous HTTP
      server by serving index.html on the root (/) and the other files in their respective locations using callbacks to
      the Async webserver.
    </li>
    <li>
      It also sets up a callback to serve internal calculated data (uptime, local ip, memory usage, etc.) in JSON format
      at <code>/data</code>.
    </li>
    <li>The JSON data is updated using a special function that executes every second and recalculates everything.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>
  <h2>Over at the client side:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Things are relatively simple here. The served index.html (and about.html) files fetch the required scripts—axios
      and feather—through a CDN and then everything is fairly static.
    </li>
    <li>
      The data available at <code>/data</code> is fetched using axios in the <code>app.js</code> script and rendered to
      the pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      The icons are replaced into the markup using <a href="https://feathericons.com/">Feather Icons</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The night mode code works in fairly standard manner by using dynamic color palettes and CSS variables that are
      manipulated with JavaScript.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
